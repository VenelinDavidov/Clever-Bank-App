Application Description – Clever Bank

Clever Bank is a web application developed with Spring Boot and Java, designed to provide essential banking functionalities in a simple and user-friendly way. Its goal is to simulate a modern digital bank where customers can manage their finances, payments, and subscriptions.

The core modules and classes of the application are:

Customer – represents the bank’s client, storing personal details, account information, and connections to other services.

Pocket – a virtual wallet where customers can keep funds, track income and expenses, and manage balances.

Transaction – handles financial operations such as transfers, deposits, and withdrawals.

Card – a digital card linked to the customer, used for payments and transactions.

Bill – enables bill management, allowing customers to track and settle their financial obligations.

Subscription – manages recurring subscriptions to various services, with automatic billing through the system.

The application follows the MVC architecture, uses Spring Data JPA for database operations, and integrates Thymeleaf for frontend rendering. Clever Bank demonstrates how Java and Spring can be used to build secure, scalable, and well-structured financial systems.
